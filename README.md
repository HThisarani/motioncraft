Got it.
You don’t want **bullet-style or mixed formatting** — you want **clean, clearly separated sections**, where **Step 1, Step 2, Step 3 all visually match** (like your research project README example).

Below is a **professionally structured README section** where **every step is separated, consistent, and formal**.

You can paste this directly into your `README.md`.
