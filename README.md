## 🎯 Design Intent

MotionCraft was designed to feel:

* Minimal but expressive
* Dark, cinematic, and modern
* Focused on **motion as storytelling**
* Inspired by creative studio portfolios rather than traditional business websites

No stock UI kits. No templates.
Everything is crafted with intent.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Page-to-page motion transitions
* CMS-driven content (Headless CMS)
* WebGL / Three.js background experiments
* Accessibility motion-reduction mode
* Performance-optimized video loading
